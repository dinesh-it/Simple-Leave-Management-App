# Simple-Leave-Management-App

* This app uses the google shared calendar feature and the google apis to give user a simple web interface for leave management
* Dont consider this application as an Office portal, this app simply present the google calander events in a different way with some filters and option
* It has very limited features and features getting added day by day
* Authentication and security is based on the permissions you have for your shared calendar
* It uses google's OAuth for login and session - So user no need to have a seperate login credentials
* App does not have a approve/deney etc.. options yet. (Will be added soon)
* Depends on a local javascript file for configuration (May not be the best way, but suits well to serve as a static frontend only page)
* Code is very bad as of now - Improvements and PR's are welcome
